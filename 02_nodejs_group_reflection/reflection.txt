Your Role:
Reflect on the role you were assigned in your group (Project Manager, Software Quality Assurance, UI/UX Designer, or Developer). Write about how you contributed to the project, what challenges you faced in this role, and what you learned.
     As a Software Quality Assurance in our group project, my job was to check if our software worked correctly and met the quality standards. I created test cases, test scenarios, and did UI/UX testing to made sure all works or functioned well or as expected and if some failed or has issues to the test I reported it to the developers.  
    One of the biggest challenges I've experience in the project was that we started creating test cases and test scenarios late because we were oriented late and realized there was a lot to do. And we are cramming because the deadline is near.   
    Through this role, I learned the importance of clear documentation, patience, and teamwork. I also gained experience in testing methods, and quality assurance processes, which will help me in the future.


Teamwork Experience:
Share your experience working as part of a team. What went well? What could be improved? Reflect on how well the team communicated, delegated tasks, and collaborated to achieve the project goals.
    Working in a team was both easy and challenging. One good thing was that we worked well together and fixed issues quickly. And sometimes it was fun because we're already having a debate in the gc espaecially the UI/UX and the developers, and the developers and SQA. The developers listened to feedback, and sometimes overwhelmed because we see the small detail or example lack of (.) in the sentences is already failed on us. 

However, testing was sometimes rushed due to deadlines, so we missed some small issues. A better plan for testing before deployment would have helped. Communication was mostly good, but developers could have given more updates about changes in the code to avoid last-minute problems.


Personal Growth and Discipline:
Think about the disciplines you want to improve.
    As an SQA Software Quality Assurance member the discipline I want to improve is time management, attention to details, and communication skills. By this improving I can become a SQA member and help deliver high-quality software.
